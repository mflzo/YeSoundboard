# YeSoundboard App


For my first ever project I decided to create a mini soundboard. Something simple but something that would allow me to learn more about creating an app. Below is the tutorial I followed to create the soundboard.

My first order of business was to think about what kind of sounds I wanted to be played, as well as what kind of theme I want the whole soundboard to be. I went with a Kanye West theme, Specifically for the app icon the Kanye West Graduation bear. So that was one of the things I did first was make an app icon that tells people it's a soundboard app, but have the theme of the bear noticeable.

After I made the app icon, I went to make the actual app. During the creation of the soundboard I followed the tutorial to the best of my abilities. With the addition of making slight tweaks to the app. After a bit I was ready to test the entire thing and the sound I played unfortunately did not work. I had the MP3 file ready and playable, but when I inserted it into the app itself, the app failed to play the sound when the connected button was clicked.
