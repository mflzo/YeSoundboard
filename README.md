# YeSoundboard App


For my first ever project I decided to create a mini soundboard. Something simple but something that would allow me to learn more about creating an app. Below is the tutorial I followed to create the soundboard.

My first order of business was to think about what kind of sounds I wanted to be played, as well as what kind of theme I want the whole soundboard to be. I went with a Kanye West theme, Specifically for the app icon the Kanye West Graduation bear. So that was one of the things I did first was make an app icon that tells people it's a soundboard app, but have the theme of the bear noticeable.

After I made the app icon, I went to make the actual app. During the creation of the soundboard I followed the tutorial to the best of my abilities. With the addition of making slight tweaks to the app. After a bit I was ready to test the entire thing and the sound I played unfortunately did not work. I had the MP3 file ready and playable, but when I inserted it into the app itself, the app failed to play the sound when the connected button was clicked.

The main layout for the app is designed to be simple but effective, I did this through have a color theme of about 4 colors and spreading them out through the different buttons and the letters. Below is an image of what the layout looks like now.

As of right now the app is sort of broken, the app functions as desired however when buttons are clicked a sound does not play. The solution to this problem should be fixed shortly but until then that is my app.
